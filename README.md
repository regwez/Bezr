[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/regwez/Bezr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/regwez/Bezr)
An ultra-fast compact data structure and sorting package written in pure swift. The idea is to build a library that is focused on high speed data manipulations with a small memory foot print.

Current it includes array searching, sorting and set operations. It works with objects as well as primitive types.

The name Bezr (bb-zz-r) is Arabic for seeds.
